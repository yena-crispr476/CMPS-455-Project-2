In Progress ---------
The repo will be used to store all our parts we do and the code associated with it. 

The main branch will be used to hold the basis for the code to run. Establishing the users and so on.

To make it easy for us, each of us can make a branch for the parts that we will complete. Towards the end, when we have all the parts finished and are ready to submit. We can merge all our branches into main. 

Note: Github Desktop may be a god method pushing changes.
